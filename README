This project renames the class names of Minecraft Classic to something that makes sense.
In the future, this project will also rename function and variable names.
To use:
Currently this project is built for Linux; Mac users may also be able to use it. Windows Batch files are also available, but have not been tested.
place a copy of JarJar in the bin folder and name it jarjar-1.1.jar, then place a copy of FernFlower in the bin folder and name it fernflower.jar.
Place your minecraft.jar (must be version 0.30) and, if you want, the wom.jar from the WOM Client into the input folder.
Then, run jarjar.sh in the bin folder to rename the class names. The modified .jar files should be saved in the output folder.
Finally, if you want, run decompile.sh in the bin folder to decompile the modified minecraft.jar. Note that the source does not recompile yet.
